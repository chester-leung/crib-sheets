## Crib Sheets for UC Berkeley EECS Classes

Collection of exam crib sheets I've made over the years for my classes at UC Berkeley. Sheets created in my later years are
more comprehensive as I gradually became a better student.

There are crib sheets for the following classes:
* CS 61B - Data Structures
* CS 61C - Great Ideas in Computer Architecture (Machine Structures)
* CS 70 - Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory
* CS 161 - Computer Security
* CS 162 - Operating Systems and System Programming
* CS 168 - Introduction to the Internet: Architecture and Protocols
* CS 170 - Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems
* CS 182 - Designing, Visualizing, and Understanding Deep Neural Networks
* CS 188 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
* CS 189 - Introduction to Machine Learning
* EE 16A - Designing Information Devices and Systems I
